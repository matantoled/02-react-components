            <p>What is a React Component?</p>
            <p>A React Component is a small piece of code that is used to render a single piece of UI.
                It is a self-contained unit of UI that can be rendered on its own, or it can be rendered inside of another component.
                A React Component is implemented as class that extends React.Component OR as a function (the new way).
                A React element can be a HTML element, a component, or a combination of both.
                A React element can also be a fragment, which is a container for other elements.
            </p>
        </div>
